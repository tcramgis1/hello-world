# hello-world

Hello, 

I'm a GIS analyst working in the drone survey industry, currently our projects utilize terrestrial lidar and photogrammetry.  I've been slowly learning to do some coding over the last few months and am interested in open source 3D modeling SLAM software similar to Cartographer and others options I've found.
